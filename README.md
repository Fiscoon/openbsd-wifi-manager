# OpenBSD Wireless Network Manager

A script to connect to wireless networks in OpenBSD in a user-friendly manner.

Usage :
	$ doas ./wifi-menu <interface\>

## To-do list
- [ ] Make the script 100% POSIX compliant
- [ ] Restructure the whole UI
- [ ] Add option to choose IEEE 802.11 modes (currently using only 11b since 11g and 11n are unstable in all my hardware)
